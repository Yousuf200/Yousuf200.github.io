## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Syed

Welcome to my personal website! This is where I share my work, thoughts, and creations.

### ðŸŽ¯ About This Site

This site is built using **Jekyll** and the **Minima** theme. It's designed to be simple, fast, and easy to maintain. I use this space to:

- ðŸ“‚ Document my personal and technical projects
- ðŸ§  Share ideas, insights, and reflections
- ðŸ“œ Write blog posts about web development, AI, and more

### ðŸ’¡ Future Additions

Coming soon:

- A blog with my latest posts
- A portfolio section for my projects
- Integration with GitHub activity
